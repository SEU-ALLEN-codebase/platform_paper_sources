# platform_paper_sources
Repository for customized data mining codes of the full-spectrum paper. 

As this work is synergetically conducted by various collaborators, the codes are a assembly of the scripts of the main authors. In short:
- The folder `yufeng` contains Python codes contributed by Yufeng Liu, including codes for the data generation and analysis of `microenvironment (Fig.3)`, `axonal primary tract motif (Fig.6)`, `cross-scale features (Fig.8)` sections. In addition, it also contains codes for the data generation of `modularization (Fig.2)`, and the initial version of `arbors (Fig.5)`;
- The folder `shengdian` contains customized Python codes for the analysis of `fullMorpho (Fig.4)` and `bouton (Fig.7)`, contributed by Shengdian Jiang;
- The folder `yingxin` is contributed by Yingxin Li, containing codes for `Data summary (Fig. 1)` and `modularization (Fig. 2)`
- The folder `sujun` contains the codes for arbor analysis (`Fig. 5`).

## Usage
Simply download the codes and run them in their respective environments, such as Python or R. For detailed instructions on each section, please refer to the individual sections.

The analyses rely on various morphometry datasets including whole brain images (~3.7 Petabytes, the data sources: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B5HLt96GdvbgXrY8OSAxXSLVoFyo9kw9/edit#gid=675915234), multiple morphometry datasets (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NwwTe840_0KQhv-zVLhw58LU9nntkb-F)

## Dependence
The repository depends on a public available repository `pylib`: https://github.com/SEU-ALLEN-codebase/pylib
